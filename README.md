This repo contains the code for my master’s thesis: differentiable
implementation of Chatterjee’s ξₙ in PyTorch.

And now, for something completely different:

what i know, i can't explain

half remembering you


but i feel it

i'm afraid

i've felt it my entire life

i haven't met you yet

doctors prod

something's wrong 

clipboard questions evaporating

with the world

from my tongue like

perfectly human, perfectly

unreachable

i don't know what it is

smiles practiced often

your laughter fades

waiting rooms

behind doors

faces

mirror questions

strange questions

staring back

behind polite

unpracticed masks

unanswered politely

but i know it's there

like a splinter in

my mind

driving me mad

"i don't like myself."

someone made me

out of focus

are you

real? am i

pretending

in the static

i dreamed

once

i've known you

hold me

before

i know again
